Calculate the ballistic trajectory of objects on Earth and Mars using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method.
The 4th order R-K method requies the user to separate two second-order differential equations of motion (for the x and y directions) into four first-order differential equations.
The solutions to the differential equations for x and y are plotted against each other to show the trajectory of a cannonball with a drag coefficient, C, and mass, m, in the x-y plane.
The solutions to the differential equations for x and y are plotted against each other to show the trajectory of a cannonball with a drag coefficient, C, and a variety of masses, m, in the x-y plane.
This code is based on odesim.py from exercise 8.5 and Dr. Kevin Schlaufman's solution to exercise 8.7 in Newman's Computational Physics textbook.
